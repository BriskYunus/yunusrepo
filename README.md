# Rock Paper Scissors in Phython!
### A electionic take on a classic game!
#### Pick your weapon and play against the computer - you'll only get a virtual sting if you lose!

Prerequisites: All you need is [Phython](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0) to play.

Clone the project, navigate to the directory - <code>cd directoryname</code> - and run the game.py file in the Python3 Terminal window for Mac / Linux.

The rules are the same as the classic game:
<ol>
<li>Paper covers Rock</li>
<li>Scissors cuts Paper</li>
<li>Rock smashes Scissors</li>
</ol>

<b><i>Choose your weapon wisely!</i></b>

The computer chooses first; just follow the prompts.

Built with Python 3.

Enjoy!
